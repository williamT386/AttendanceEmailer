## Development Information
This program runs on Google's App Script, which uses Javascript and Html. To run the software, the user deploys the web application. When the webpage is being loaded, data stored in the spreadsheet is cleaned and returned to the webpage for display. After the user hits the Submit button on the webpage, the data on the webpage is sent to the server side for emails to be sent and data appended to the spreadsheet. The server side returns the new information to display the client side, which is the web app.
